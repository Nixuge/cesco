## Why Cesco ?
* ### Cesco is **free** and **open source**.
  * The philosophy of Cesco is to want a **more open internet**, in a **spirit of exchange** and not of profits.
  * Cesco does not have and **will never have advertising or paid subscriptions**
* ### Cesco is focused on **privacy** : 
  * Unlike many other social networks, Cesco **does not collect any personal data about you**.
  * Many social networks have personalized recommendations, based on collected personal data. **On cescosit, you can choose the order of the posts with the click of a button**.
* ### Cesco thinks that everyone has the right to **express himself**.
  * We let **everyone have their say**, regardless of their opinion.
  * Everybody can say his opinion, but it doesn't mean that you can say what you want against someone, that's why we have very clear [rules](https://rmbi.ch/Cesco/pages/rules.html) on the subject.
  * ### Why not ??

### Enjoy üòÅ!!
