# CescoSite
⚠️ Right bow, CescoSite is only in french, but in future update it will be multy-languages ⚠️
## Why CescoSite ?
* ### CescoSite is **free** and **open source**.
  * The philosophy of cescosite is to want a **more open internet**, in a **spirit of exchange** and not of profits.
* ### CescoSite is focused on **privacy** : 
  * Unlike many other social networks, CescoSite **does not collect any personal data about you**.
  * Many social networks have personalized recommendations, based on collected personal data. **On cescosit, you can choose the order of the posts with the click of a button**.
* ### CescoSite thinks that everyone has the right to **express himself**.
  * We let **everyone have their say**, regardless of their opinion.
  * Everybody can say his opinion, but it doesn't mean that you can say what you want against someone, that's why we have very clear [rules](https://rmbi.ch/cescosite/pages/rules.html) on the subject.

### Enjoy 😁!!
